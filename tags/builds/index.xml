      <description>Introduction According to CMake&amp;rsquo;s own site, &amp;ldquo;CMake is an open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to build, test and package software.&amp;rdquo; What does that mean for a developer? It means that you can write a platform agnostic description of what should happen at build time and should (hopefully) not have to fret about it not working when you switch from your Linux machine to your Mac or from your Mac to your Windows machine or even just a Linux machine to a Linux machine with libraries installed in different places.</description>
